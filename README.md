# Gesture Garage

Gesture Garage is a full-stack web application that allows home and professional mechanics to follow vehicle maintenance guides hands-free using gesture recognition. The app is designed for both desktop and mobile, enabling intuitive navigation through repair steps using a webcam and Mediapipe.

## Project Overview

This project addresses the challenge of interacting with repair guides in environments where users may have greasy, dirty, or full hands. By using hand gestures to navigate guide steps, users can keep their focus on the task without needing to touch a screen or device.
